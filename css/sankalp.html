      <h2>about us</h2>
        <h3 class="moto">"This life is short, the vanities of the world are transient, but they alone live who live for others, the rest are more dead then alive." â€“ Swami Vivekananda</h3>
     <p> SANKALP, it's not merely a club or a group of people. The name 'Sankalp' itself suggests passion, enthusiasm and determination towards the betterment of society. We as a team spread awareness regarding spirituality, humanity and all those things that could make the youth a better person and could lead the society to a better tomorrow.</P>
<p>
The modern fantasies of 21st century have made the youth forget about the presence of almighty and have lead the people lose their faith in humanity. Sankalp makes an effort to conquer all these misleads. It celebrates each and every occasion and brings out a spiritual atmosphere to make youth realize the power of God so that they could feel his presence. The concept of regular meetings that deal with the open discussion on topics such as 'What is Truth', 'Why should one be helpful to others' etc helps out the students to have clear mindsets and a sole way to think in right direction. Certain trips to help poor people by providing them necessities and visiting orphanages and old age homes is what gives immense pleasure.</p>
